Routing Tutorial
----------------

Routing is done via file-based routing thanks to [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest). This means that each route is a file in the `src/routes` directory. The file should export a React component as default.

1.	Make sure the app is running via `p run dev`
2.	Create a new file in `src/routes` named either `routename/index.tsx` or `routename.tsx`. Both are the same.
3.	The file should export a React component as default.
